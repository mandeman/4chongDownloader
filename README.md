# 4chongDownloader
Download media from a 4chan thread
Really basic stuff right now.
1. Paste the thread link in the URL.
2. Specify the media storage location.
3. Hit enter.
4. Enjoy your anime girls.
If you have shitty internet like I do, the downloader may stop. Just enter the number on the left in the log file when it prompts you to do so in the next run.
Delete the log files if you want to. They aren't overwriten so you'll just end up with a ton of log files if you keep them.
If you run this on PyCharm, it'll take you to the link when you hit enter after the URL. Please help if you know a way out of this. Using cmd for now.
